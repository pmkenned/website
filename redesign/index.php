    <p>Hello, and welcome to my personal website.</p>

    <p>Here are my goals for this website:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>To be fast</li>
        <li>To use minimal JavaScript</li>
        <li>To be ad-free and privacy-respecting</li>
        <li>To be open-source</li>
        <li>To be easy to navigate</li>
        <li>To be aesthetically pleasing</li>
        <li>To be printer- and mobile-friendly</li>
        <li>To provide useful content</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Internet in general and the World Wide Web in particular are incredible innovations, and it is easy to forget how amazing they really are. And yet, often times browsing the web is a painful, frustrating, and all-around unpleasant experience. </p>

    <p>Part of my aim in creating this website is to fight against this trend in my own tiny way, and to present an example of the kind of experience I want to have when using the web.</p>
